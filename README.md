# Intro

I have been trying to make a schedule for a python course for my kids [here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/pythoncourse); one of the things that i would like to do is a game with pygame.
Now there are lots of nice pygame tutorials, I followed the following [Pygame primer](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/) the source code for the tutorial is [here](https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/pygame-a-primer)

The tutorial was great, the documentation for pygame is adquate, however there was one thing missing - fun; doing something in pygame is real work.

Compare that to what I had in my youth: I got my intro to programming on a [TI 99/4A home computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A) with a 16 kilobyte extended Basic ROM cartridge; I had tons of fun programming games with the sprite graphics, and the result was not so much different as compare to what you have with pygame.

Now this project is trying to make a wrapper, that is hiding some of the complexity of the pygame package (yes, it has a lot of details in it).
Here is the result: 

1) The PyWrap module holds the wrapper for pygame
2) the root directory holds a sequence of files that develop a game, each one is adding a feature on top of the previous one.
